# Overview
This Web application serves as a test subject for the Jasmine testing framework.
Upon loading, a navigable RSS feed page will be displayed along with the
Jasmine FeedReader containing a summary of the tests run on the page.

# Installation
In order to run this application, first download the folder titled project_7.
Be sure that it contains the css/, fonts/, jasmine/, and js/ folders, along
with the executable index.html file and the README (this file).

# Running
To launch the application, run the index.html in your Web browser. Certain
tests simulate user interaction, so the RSS feed page may change in appearance.
However, actual interaction with the page will not interfere with the test
procedures.
